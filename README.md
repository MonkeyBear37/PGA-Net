# PGA-Net
Our PGA-Net is capable of distillating, selecting, and fusing the discriminative and attention-aware features at different scales and different levels (i.e., both semantic and natural levels). Meanwhile, focusing on fusing features both selectively and comprehensively, PGA-Net can demonstrate remarkable stability and encouraging performance even without  pre-training, making the model can be trained truly from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PGA-Net through validating on COCO and MPII benchmarks, attaining new state-of-the-art performance.
